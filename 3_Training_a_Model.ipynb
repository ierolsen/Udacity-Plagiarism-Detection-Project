    "There are many ways to improve or add on to this project to expand your learning or make this more of a unique project for you. A few ideas are listed below:\n",
    "* Train a classifier to predict the *category* (1-3) of plagiarism and not just plagiarized (1) or not (0).\n",
    "* Utilize a different and larger dataset to see if this model can be extended to other types of plagiarism.\n",
    "* Use language or character-level analysis to find different (and more) similarity features.\n",
    "* Write a complete pipeline function that accepts a source text and submitted text file, and classifies the submitted text as plagiarized or not.\n",
    "* Use API Gateway and a lambda function to deploy your model to a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all just options for extending your work. If you've completed all the exercises in this notebook, you've completed a real-world application, and can proceed to submit your project. Great job!"
